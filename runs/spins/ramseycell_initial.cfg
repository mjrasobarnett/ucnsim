[Name]
   % Run name defines the name of the 'Run' object, which is used when searching
   % for this object in a file
   RunName = GeneratedParticles
   
%-------------------------------------------
% Input/Output -- Lists files needed by simulation
%-------------------------------------------
[Files] 
   % File containing the Geometry to simulate
   GeomFile = runs/spins/ramseycell_geom.root
   % File containing the Geometry made for visualisation
   GeomVisFile = runs/spins/ramseycell_geom.root 
   % All initial particle data will be written to here
   OutputDataFile = runs/spins/ramseycell_initialparticles.root

% Neutrons to Generate
%-------------------------------------------
% Below are parameters related to the initial generation of particles for the simulation.
% Particles created by this are stored in the InputDataFile
[Neutrons]
   % Number of neutrons to be created initially by the generate_particles macro 
   InitialParticles = 10
   % Set cut-off velocity on a 'v^2' distribution. Neutrons will be generated up to this value
   InitialMaxVelocity = 8.0
   % Filling time defines an interval in which UCN will be created at random
   FillingTime = 0.0

[Spin]
   PercentagePolarised = 100.0; % Default is 100.0;
   % Set Spin axis (i.e: Axis along which we are polarising UCN)
   SpinAxisX = 1.0
   SpinAxisY = 0.0
   SpinAxisZ = 0.0
   % Set Spin state ('eigenvalue') i.e: Up or Down
   SpinState = Up
