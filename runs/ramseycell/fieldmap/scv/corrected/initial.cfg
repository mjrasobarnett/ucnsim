[Name]
   % Run name defines the name of the 'Run' object, which is used when searching
   % for this object in a file
   RunName = GeneratedParticles
   
%-------------------------------------------
% Input/Output -- Lists files needed by simulation
%-------------------------------------------
[Files] 
   % File containing the Geometry to simulate
   GeomFile = ramseycell_geom.root
   % File containing the Geometry made for visualisation
   GeomVisFile =
   % All initial particle data will be written to here
   OutputDataFile = initialparticles.root

% Neutrons to Generate
%-------------------------------------------
% Below are parameters related to the initial generation of particles for the simulation.
% Particles created by this are stored in the InputDataFile

% Beam defines a 'virtual' volume within which the particles will be distributed evenly 
[Beam]
   % Define beam shape -- can only choose tube or box
   Shape = Tube
   % Define Size of beam in Units of (m)
   Radius = 0.125 % in case of box this is the x-y half length)
   Length = 0.045  % z-coord
   % Define Rotation matrix to place Beam in Geometry
   Phi = 90.0   % Units of Degrees
   Theta = 90.0
   Psi = 0.0
   % Define Translation matrix to place Beam in Geometry
   XPos = 0.0  % Units of (m)
   YPos = 0.0
   ZPos = 0.0
   
[Neutrons]
   % Number of neutrons to be created initially by the generate_particles macro 
   InitialParticles = 10000
   % Set cut-off velocity on a 'v^2' distribution. Neutrons will be generated up to this value
   InitialMaxVelocity = 8.0
   % Filling time defines an interval in which UCN will be created at random
   FillingTime = 0.0

[Direction]
   % Direction defines the angular spread of particle directions. All particle will have
   % a momentum vector directed randomly with theta, phi between limits set below
   MinTheta = 0.0
   MaxTheta = 180.0
   MinPhi = 0.0
   MaxPhi = 360.0

[Spin]
   PercentagePolarised = 100.0; % Default is 100.0;
   % Set Spin axis (i.e: Axis along which we are polarising UCN)
   SpinAxisX = 0.0
   SpinAxisY = 0.0
   SpinAxisZ = 1.0
   % Set Spin state ('eigenvalue') i.e: Up or Down
   SpinState = Up
